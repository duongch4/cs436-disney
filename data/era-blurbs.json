        "description": "The Pre-Golden Age set the stage for Disney as we know it. In 1928, Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks created one of the most recognizable animated characters of all time: Mickey Mouse. The mouse was featured in Steamboat Willie, the first Disney cartoon to be synchronized with sound. The film was an instant success, receiving critical acclaim for this technical innovation. This success resulted in a series of Mickey Mouse cartoons to be released which saw the introduction of many staple Disney characters including Minnie Mouse, Pluto and Goofy."

    "Golden Age": {
        "years": "1937 - 1942",
        "description": "The Golden Age began with in 1937 with the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It made cinematic history as the first feature-length animated film, establishing Disney as one of the leaders of animated filmmaking. Most of the other films of this era, though now viewed as all-time classics, did not see the same success. Despite the box office disappointments, this time is still considered the Golden Age because of the trends, quality and technical achievements that were created. Disney staples like exaggerated villains and comedic sidekicks were first introduced at this time."

    "Wartime Era": {
        "years": "1943 - 1949",
        "description": "Following the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the USA’s entry into World War II, Disney Studios experienced lower budgets and dwindling animation teams as many animators were lost to the war effort. Without the manpower to release full-length films, the studio released “package films” consisting of a series of individual short films that were loosely connected around a central theme. These films were largely criticized by fans due to their lack of consistency and tone. Disney Studios was also overtaken at this time by the US government to produce wartime propaganda, including anti-Nazi commercials and flyers encouraging Americans to support the war."

    "Silver Age": {
        "years": "1950 - 1969",
        "description": "The Silver Age saw the revival of Disney Studios and its return to innovation and quality. In this era, Disney returned to the classic fairytale and storybook storytelling of the early classics with gorgeous big-budget featured films. They were filled with beautiful animations, complex characters, and fantastical stories. Productions of these films also introduced many innovations designed to reduce production costs and speed up the process, including cel xeroxing first used in 101 Dalmations. The end of the Silver Age is marked by The Jungle Book which was the last film that Walt Disney himself worked on before his death in 1966."

    "Dark Age": {
        "years": "1970 - 1988",
        "description": "The Dark Age saw Disney Studios struggle to find their way following the passing of Walt Disney. It was a time of trial-and-error as animators explored interesting and unique ideas but failed to capture the ‘magic’ of previous generations. Most of the films in this era –though now cult classics – were commercially unsuccessful and often criticized for only being intended to bring in money. By the end of this era, Disney Studios began facing real competition for the first time. The Great Mouse Detective was beaten at the box office by Amblin Entertainment’s An American Tail, and Oliver & Company was crushed by The Land Before Time. "
